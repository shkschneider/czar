- `!!` abort() if _null_
- `array<T>` and `[]`slices, `pair<T:T>`, `map<T:T>`
- `#assert` if condition is false
- autofree when going out-of-scope
- `! & | ^ << >>` bitwise operators
- `bool`
- built-in formatter
- built-in inspector
- callee can only receive a parameter as `mut` if the caller gave it `mut`
- customizable memory allocators (`#malloc` `#free`...)
- `#DEBUG` to get or set global debug flag
# Features
- `#FILE` injects current file
- floats `f32/64`
- `fn function_name(parameters...) return_type`
- `for idx, item in iterable {}`
- `#FUNCTION` injects current function name
- identifiers length must be less than 256 long
- `if {} elseif {} else {}`
- `if this and that {}` logical and
- `if this or that {}` logical or

- increment`++` and decrement`--` as prefix and suffix
- integers `i8/16/32/64`
- `#LINE` injects current line number of current file
- `#log` to log to stderr
- `module module_name` defaults to "main"
- more compiler warnings
- `mut` i32 allows to change its value
- `mut` of a struct allows to change its members
- named and default parameters
- `new` allocates on heap (pointer)
- `null` _(void*)0_, `void` (nothing), `any` (_void*_)
- operator compounds: `+= -= *= /= %=`
- package "main" is mandatory for multiple files
- pointers: `type* name`
- private by default
- `pub` to set visibility to "public" (outside of module)

- stack usage should be less than 1MB and must be less than 2MB
- `string` type
- struct constructor method `new()` and destructor `free()`
- `struct Name { members... }`
- struct with methods: `fn Name:method() {}` with implicit `self`

> unordered
- `#unsafe {}` to embed raw C code
- unsigned integers `u8/16/32/64`
- unused `_` anything
- variables: `type name`
- `var or fallback` sets to _fallback_ is var is false or null
- `while condition {}`
