*Just kidding.*

This is a toy language I'm trying to make to learn more about languages and compilation.

- [extended-c](https://github.com/shkschneider/czar/tree/extended-c)
    is a branch with .h/.c files to extend on the standard c library in an effort to make C better for me
- [lua-to-c](https://github.com/shkschneider/czar/tree/lua-to-c)
    is a transpiler from .cz to .c first written in lua then self-hosted

**This is a pet project and will probably never be used.**
