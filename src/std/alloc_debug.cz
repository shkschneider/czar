// alloc_debug.cz - Debug allocator with memory tracking
// Part of the Czar standard library
// Tracks allocations/frees and detects memory leaks

// Note: This is a module interface that configures the code generator
// to emit memory tracking code and print statistics at program exit
// The actual implementation is generated by codegen/memory.lua
// No struct is needed as this is handled by the #alloc directive
