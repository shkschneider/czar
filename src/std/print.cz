// print.cz - Print functions for formatted output
// Part of the Czar standard library

// Note: Print functions are implemented as special static methods in the cz module
// The actual implementations are in src/raw/cz_print.c
// These functions are called via cz.print(), cz.println(), cz.printf()
// No struct is needed as these are module-level functions
